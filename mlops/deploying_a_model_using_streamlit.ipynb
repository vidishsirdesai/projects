    "# What Is Streamlit?\n",
    "Streamlit is a Python tool that helps in building a website in no time. It is not a requirement for a Data Scientist to know front-end and back-end development and the connections between them, this is a job of a Software Developer. But, it is an essential requirement for a Data Scientist to show the working of a model, with visualizations included, to the stake holders. In this case, building a simple application that allows the user to interact with the various parameters and visualize the output etc, becomes essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit serves exactly this requirement of a Data Scientist without him/ her known the fundamentals of web development (front-end and back-end).\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit is popularly by used by Data Scientists and Analysts for building a POC (proof of concept) app."
