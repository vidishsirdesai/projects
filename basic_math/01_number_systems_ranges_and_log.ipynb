    "# Number System\n",
    "- In Mathematics, the decimal system is widely used while working with numbers. It contains the following numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and is represented with \"base 10\", or just \"10\" in its subscript. For example, 26 in decimal notation is written as, $(26)_{10}$.\n",
    "- In an Electronic device, the binary number system is used. It contains 0 and 1, and is represented with \"base 2\" or just \"2\" in its subscript. For example, 26 in binary is written as, $(11010)_{2}$.\n",
    "- Decimal number system, \n",
    "    - $96542 = (9\\times10^{4}) + (6\\times10^{3}) + (5\\times10^{2}) + (4\\times10^{1}) + (2\\times10^{0})$.\n",

    "- When converting a number from decimal to binary, the agenda should be to build the decimal number under question using the numbers lower than the number, the constraint is that, the lower numbers used should all be powers of 2. For example, $(26)_{10} = (11010)_{2}$.\n",
