    "# Introduction\n",
    "Elliptical envelope, while effective has limitations. It limited to uni-modal and continuous data. Meaning, it struggles with data that isn't neatly distributed around a single peak (uni0modal) or with categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation forest is a powerful alternative for outlier detection, addressing some of these shortcomings. It can work with multi-modal data, and accomodates for both, numerical and categorical features within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition behind isolation forest\n",
    "Isolation forest leverages the idea that outliers are inherently easier to isolate from the rest of the data. Their behavior deviates significantly from the \"normal\" patterns."
