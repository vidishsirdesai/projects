# Introduction
Unsupervised learning models are applied on data that only has features and no label/ target variable. For example,

| age | income | total_purchase_value | number of orders |
| :-: | :----: | :------------------: | :--------------: |

The task of an unsupervised learning algorithm is not to make a prediction, but to find a relationship or similarity between rows or a cluster of rows.
