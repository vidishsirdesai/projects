    "# Building A Model For Multi-Class Classification\n",
    "A simple Logistic Regression cannot be used to for multi-class classification. A simple Logistic Regression is equivalent to single-neuron model and can only be used to classify 2 classes. In order to implement Logistic Regression for multi-class classification multiple Logistic Regression models will have to be built (OvR).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if there are 3 classes, then 3 models will have to be trained.\n",

    "- The probability of a given data point belonging to either one of the classes (A, B or C) is calculated.\n",

    "# Notations In Neural Networks\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "Consider that there are 2 features, $x_1$ and $x_2$ and $m$ data points. This is represeted as a matrix where each row is a data point. It looks as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",

    "### Neuron\n",
    "Neuron is represented using $f_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",

    "What if the model predict a probability value greater than 0.5 for multiple classes (i.e., $A$, $B$, $C$ = $\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\space 1 \\space 0\\end{bmatrix}$ or $A$, $B$, $C$ = $\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\space 1 \\space 1\\end{bmatrix}$)?\n",

    "The actual requirement is that, the sum of all output probabilities should be equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can multiple outputs be 1?\n",
    "Since the sigmoid activation function is applied to each output and the range of the sigmoid function is, $\\sigma \\in (0, 1)$. Therefore, multiple probabilitiy values can be greater than 0.5 and hence multiple class labels can be 1."
