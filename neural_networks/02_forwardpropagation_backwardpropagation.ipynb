    "# Building A Model For Multi-Class Classification\n",
    "A simple Logistic Regression cannot be used to for multi-class classification. A simple Logistic Regression is equivalent to single-neuron model and can only be used to classify 2 classes. In order to implement Logistic Regression for multi-class classification multiple Logistic Regression models will have to be built (OvR).\n",
