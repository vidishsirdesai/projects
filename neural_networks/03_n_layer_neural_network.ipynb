    "In the above figure, superscript notation is used to represent the layer. Therefore, representing with $f_1$, $f_1^1$ is used (i.e., neuron 1 of layer 1).\n",

    "- $a_2$ will be non-linear and much more complex than $a_1$, $a_2 = (9x_1^2 + 16x_2^2 + 24x_1x_2 +1)^2 = (9x_1^2 + 16x_2^2)^2 + 2(9x_1^2 + 16x_2^2)(24x_1x_2 +1) + (24x_1x_2 +1)^2$\n",
