# Introduction
Recomender systems are a type of information filtering system that predict the ratings or preference a user would give to an item. They'are designed to suggest items that are most pertinent to a particular user.

Types of recommender systems,
- Collaborative filtering: Recommends items based on the preferences of similar users.
- Content-based filtering: Recommends items based on the user's past interactions with similar items.
- Hybrid systems: Collabrative and and content-based filtering are combined for more accurate recommendation.

Common use cases include,
- Product recommendations: E-commerce platforms like Amazon and Netflix use them to suggest products or movies to users.
- Music and media: Spotify, YouTube and Pandora use them to recommend songs, videos and podcasts.
- News and content: News aggregators and social media platforms use them to personalize news feeds and content recommendations.
- Job recommnedations: Job boards use them to match job seekers with suitable job openings.

Given are a 3 dataset containing information about users, ratings and movies for a streaming platform. Using nearest neighbors algorithm and cosine similarity, an item-based collaborative filtering recommender system application is built as a part of this project.

# Insights From The Dataset

# Deployment Steps
### Virtual environment setup
1. `cd <project_directory_path>`.
2. `pip install virtualenv`.
3. `python<version> -m venv <virtual_environment_name>` or `python3 -m venv .venv`.
4. A folder named "`.venv`" will appear in the project directory.
5. Activate the virtual environment using one of the commands listed below depending on the Operating System,
    - MacOS and Linux, `source .venv/bin/activate`.
    - Windows command prompt, `.venv/Scripts/activate.bat`.
6. Once the virtual environment is active, the environment name (in this case "`.venv`") will be visible in the parantheses before the prompt, like so "`(.venv)`".
7. To confirm if the virtual environment has successfully been create, run `pip list`. The following should be the output,
```
(.venv) vidish@Vidishs-MacBook-Air network_anomaly_detection % pip list
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        xx.x.x
setuptools xx.x.x
``` 
8. To deactivate the virtual environment, strictly run the following 2 commands in the same order,
    - `deactivate`.
    - `rm -r .venv`.

### Installing dependencies
1. Once the virtual environment is created, create a `.txt` file named, `requirement.txt`.
2. Add the names of the dependent (required) packages (libraries) that are required by the app to be functioning. The below is the list of packages that are required,
```
numpy
pandas
sklearn
flask
pickle
```
3. Once the `requirement.txt` file is created with all the dependencies included as a part of the file, save the file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the terminal.
4. `pip list` can be run to check if the installation of all the packages has been successful.

### Show recommender app
1. To run the application,
    - `cd src`.
    - `FLASK_APP=show_recommender_app.py flask run`.
2. To view the welcome page, goto, http://127.0.0.1:5000.
3. To classify the anomaly type or the attack type, send a POST request to, http://127.0.0.1:5000/recommendations.
4. The POST request can be sent by running the following command in a terminal window:
```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"movie_name": "Liar Liar"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/recommedations
```
5. Expected response: `{"0":"Mrs. Dalloway","1":"Abyss, The","2":"Duets","3":"Holy Smoke","4":"Way of the Gun, The","5":"Wedding Gift, The","6":"Auntie Mame","7":"Theory of Flight, The","8":"Leading Man, The","9":"Mask of Zorro, The"}`.

# API Specification
### Base URL
http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Endpoints
- GET `/`: Returns a text indicating the application's purpose.
- POST `/recommendations`: Returns an output containing recommendations.

### Request format for POST /recommendations
Content-Type: application/json

The request body should be a JSON object containing the following features of a network connection,
- `movie_name` (str): Name of a movie (for example, "Chariots of Fire", "Mission: Impossible", "Jungle Book, The", "Rush Hour", "Liar Liar").

### Response format for POST /recommendations
The response will be a JSON object containing the names of movies that are similar to the queried movie.
