# Introduction
Detecting anomalies (threats or attacks) in a network is a crucial task in cybersecurity. It involves identifying unusual patterns in the network traffic. The traditional methods that are commonly deployed to detect anomalies in the network, rely on predefined set of rules based on known attack patterns. The problem with these is that they fail at recognizing threats that previously have not been encountered.

The challenge lies in accurately detecting these anomalies in real-time, where the network traffic is immense, and often noisy and heterogenous

With attackers finding new ways to bypass traditional security measures, cyber threats are evolving continuously. Also, new devices get added to the network time and again, this implies that a network is forever growing in size. Monitoring the various parameters associated with a network to find potential threats becomes increasingly difficult as a result. Hence, it is imperative to have a system in place that is both robust and adaptive in recognizing threats and threat patterns.
- Robust, because it has to cater to the need of threat detection in a network that is growing continuously.
- Adaptive, because it has to continuously evolve by learning from new incoming data and recognize threats.

To address these issue, multiple ML models have been built as a part of an experiment to find the best model that identifies threat patterns and classifies a network connection into either a normal or one of the attack types. This type of classification problem in machine learning (ML) is called as a multi-class classification problem.

# Deployment Steps
### Virtual environment setup
1. `cd <project_directory_path>`.
2. `pip install virtualenv`.
3. `python<version> -m venv <virtual_environment_name>` or `python3 -m venv .venv`.
4. A folder named "`.venv`" will appear in the project directory.
5. Activate the virtual environment using one of the commands listed below depending on the Operating System,
    - MacOS and Linux, `source .venv/bin/activate`.
    - Windows command prompt, `.venv/Scripts/activate.bat`.
6. Once the virtual environment is active, the environment name (in this case "`.venv`") will be visible in the parantheses before the prompt, like so "`(.venv)`".
7. To confirm if the virtual environment has successfully been create, run `pip list`. The following should be the output,
```
(.venv) vidish@Vidishs-MacBook-Air network_anomaly_detection % pip list
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        xx.x.x
setuptools xx.x.x
``` 
8. To deactivate the virtual environment, strictly run the following 2 commands in the same order,
    - `deactivate`.
    - `rm -r .venv`.

### Installing dependencies
1. Once the virtual environment is created, create a `.txt` file named, `requirement.txt`.
2. Add the names of the dependent (required) packages (libraries) that are required by the app to be functioning. The below is the list of packages that are required,
```
flask
pickle
pandas
scikit-learn
```
3. Once the `requirement.txt` file is created with all the dependencies included as a part of the file, save the file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the terminal.
4. `pip list` can be run to check if the installation of all the packages has been successful.

### Network anomaly classification model
Gradient boosting decision tree was found to be the best model. Therefore, the same is chosen to build the classification app. The model is trained and the trained model is serialized using "`pickle`".

`pickle` is a Python package that is a powerful tool for serializing and deserializing Python objects.

Refer the following notebook where all of the above has been executed, 
- Notebook: [gbdt_classifier.ipynb](notebooks/gbdt_classifier.ipynb).

### Network anomaly classifier app
1. To run the application,
    - `cd src`.
    - `FLASK_APP=network_anomaly_classification_app.py flask run`.
2. To view the welcome page, goto, http://127.0.0.1:5000.
3. To classify the anomaly type or the attack type, send a POST request to, http://127.0.0.1:5000/classify_network_anomaly.
4. The POST request can be sent by running the following command in a terminal window: 
```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"duration": 38044, "srcbytes": 1, "dstbytes": 0, "land": 0, "wrongfragment": 0, "urgent": 0, "hot": 0, "numfailedlogins": 0, "loggedin": 0, "numcompromised": 0, "rootshell": 0, "suattempted": 0, "numfilecreations": 0, "numshells": 0, "numaccessfiles": 0, "ishostlogin": 0, "count": 2, "srvcount": 2, "serrorrate": 0.0, "rerrorrate": 1.0, "samesrvrate": 1.0, "diffsrvrate": 0.0, "srvdiffhostrate": 0.0, "dsthostcount": 255, "dsthostsrvcount": 2, "dsthostdiffsrvrate": 0.5, "dsthostsamesrcportrate": 1.0, "dsthostsrvdiffhostrate": 0.0, "protocol": "tcp", "service": "Z39_50", "flag": "RSTR"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/classify_network_anomaly
```
5. Expected response: `{"Attack Type":"Probe"}`.
