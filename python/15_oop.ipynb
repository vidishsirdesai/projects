    "\n",
    "Every object that is created from a particular class is an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",

For a class and object, collectively, there are actions (functions or more accurately methods) and properties (variables). When a blueprint is created, all the common properties related to every object will be defined in that class.\n",

    "2. Object creation: To create an instance of the class, the class name followed by parenthesis is used. This is called object creation or instantiation. Instantiation allocates memory for the object and sets up its initial state based on the class's constructor (usually the `__init__` method in Python). Meaning, if the class is expected to be instantiated with a certain attributes, then those attributes have to be passed while the object is being created.\n",
    "3. Accessing attributes and methods: Once the object is created, its attributes can be accessed and its methods can be called as defined in the class. Each object will have its own set of data but shares the same methods and behaviors defined by the class."
