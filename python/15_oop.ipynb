    "# OOP\n",
    "Object oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (an example, or rather one of many approaches to programming).\n",

    "There are 2 popular approaches towards programming,\n",
    "1. Functional.\n",
    "2. Object oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP in principle is fairly simple. Everything is an object in Python, this is because, Python inherently follows OOP (meaning, it is built around OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 things associated with OOP,\n",
    "1. Class: A class is a blueprint of an object. Class defines the blueprint that an object can or will have.\n",
    "2. Object: An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object that is created from a particular class is an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Car is blueprint and Mini Cooper is an object of that class. Meaning, Mini Cooper is an instance of the Car class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example can be, 5 is an object of the class `int`, 5 is also an instance of the class `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take strings for example, a lot of \"actions\" can be performed on strings (concatenate, split, lowercase, uppercase, etc). For a class and object, collectively, there are actions (functions or more accurately methods) and properties (variables). When a blueprint is created, all the common properties related to every object will be defined in that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a class `Human`, height, weight, gender, etc are all properties (variable). Breathing, walking, eating, etc are all actions (methods)."

    "Instantiating a class means creating an object (or instance) of that class. In object-oriented programming, classes serve as blueprints or templates for creating objects. When a class is instantiated, a specific instance of that class is created and this instance will have the attributes and behaviors defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of instantiating a class typically involves the following steps,\n",
    "1. Class definition: First, a class is defined. The class serves as a blueprint, specifying the structure and behavior of objects to be created from it. This includes defining attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
    "2. Object creation: To create an instance of the class, the class name followed by parenthesis is used. This is called object creation or instantiation. Instantiation allocates memory for the object and sets up its initial state based on the class's constructor (usually the `__init__` method in Python). Meaning, if the class is expected to be instantiated with a certain attributes, then those attributes have to be passed while the object is being created.\n",
    "3. Accessing attributes and methods: Once the object is created, its attributes can be accessed and its methods can be called as defined in the class. Each object will have its own set of data but shares the same methods and behaviors defined by the class."

    "A class variable, also known as class attribute, is a variable that belongs to a class rather than a specific instance (object) of the class.

Class variables are defined at the class level and not within the methods of the class.\n",

    "2. `@classmethod` decorator: To define a class method, the `@classmethod` decorator is used before the method definition. This decorator indicates that the method is a class method and it should take a reference to the class itself as its first parameter, commonly names `cls` (short for class).\n",
    "3. Access to class attributes: Inside a class method, the class attributes (variables) can be accessed and operations can be performed on them. Class attributes are shared among all instances of the class and are accessible using `cls.class_attribute_name`.\n",
    "4. Common tasks: Class methods are often used for tasks that involve the class as a whole. This can include creating instances with specific characteristics or performing class-wide operations, such as maintaining counters or configuring class-level settings.\n",
    "5. Invocation: Class methods are invoked on the class itself, rather than on instances. To call a class method, the class name followed by the method name should be used, like `MyClass.class_method()`.\n",
