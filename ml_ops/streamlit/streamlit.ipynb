    "# What is Streamlit?\n",
    "Streamlit is a Python tool that helps in building a website in no time. It is not a requirement for a Data Scientist to know front-end and back-end development, this is a job of a Software Developer. But, it is an essential requirement for a Data Scientist to show the working of a model, with visualizations included, to the stake holders. In this case a building simple application that allows the user to interact with the various parameters and visualize the output etc, becomes essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit serves exactly this requirement of a Data Scientist without him/ her known the fundamentals of web development (front-end and back-end).\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit is popularly by used by Data Scientists and Analysts for building a POC (proof of concept) app."

    "# Installing Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "1. Python version 3.8 to 3.12.\n",
    "2. A Python environment manager: Environment managers create virtual environments to isolate Python package installations between projects. It is recommended that virtual environments be used because installing or upgrading a Python package may cause unintentional effects on another package. Here, `venv` is used.\n",
    "3. A Python package manager, popularly `pip` is the go to one.\n",
    "4. A code editor, like *VS Code*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create an environment using `venv`\n",
    "1. `cd <project_folder_path>`.\n",
    "2. `python3 -m venv .venv`.\n",
    "3. A folder named \".venv\" will appear in your project. This directory is where your virtual environment and its dependencies are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before an environment is created, create a *.txt* file with the name *requirements.txt*. This tells what the different libraries that the project requires. The following should be included inside *requirements.txt*:\n",
    "- `streamlit`\n",
    "- `scikit-learn`\n",
    "- `numpy`\n",
    "- `pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activate the environment\n",
    "In the terminal, activate the environment with one of the following commands depending on the opearating system,\n",
    "- Windows command prompt, `.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat`\n",
    "- Windows PowerShell, `.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`\n",
    "- macOS and Linux `source .venv/bin/activate``\n"
