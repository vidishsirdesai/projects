    "2. Identify all the different columns required in the output. Mention if the columns are available or if they need to be created.\n",
    "3. Identify the various keywords needed that are to solve a given question.\n",
    "4. If multiple tables need to be combined, apply the appropriate `join`. Make sure the `on` keyword is used correctly in this context.\n",
    "5. For filter condition, identify all special operators or keywords that are needed to solve the given question. If there are multiple conditions, see if they need to be joined with `and`, `or`, etc.\n",
    "6. Check for `order by` and `limit` condition if any.\n",
    "7. Arrange all the statements in the correct order and execute the query.\n",

    "### Order of execution\n",
    "SQL queries adhere to a specific order when evaluating clauses, similar to BODMAS or PEMDAS or BIDMAS. From the eyes of the user, queries begin from the first command and end at the last command. However, the queries are not actually read from the top to bottom when they are executed.\n",
