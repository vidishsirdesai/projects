    "1. Aggregates with comparisons: Sub-queries are useful when you want to compare a value from one table with an aggregate value (e.g., average, count) from another table. This can be difficult to achieve efficiently with joins alone.\n",
    "2. Handling duplicates: If you need to include duplicates resulting from the comparison between tables, a subquery might be necessary. Joins typically exclude duplicates by default.\n",
    "3. Complex filtering: For very specific filtering logic that involves multiple conditions or sub-queries within the filtering itself, a sub-query can be easier to write and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in most scenarios, joins are generally preferred for the following reasons,\n",
    "- Performance: Joins are often optimized by databases, leading to faster queries compared to subqueries which require processing the inner query first.\n",
    "- Readability: For simpler tasks involving combining data from related tables, joins can result in clearer and more concise code."
