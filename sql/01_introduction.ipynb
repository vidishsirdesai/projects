    "DBMS stands for Data Base Management System.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBMS contains a set of programs to access and manipulate the data stored in a database. DBMS takes care of things like efficiency, consistency, speed, security, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DBMS is nothing more than a computerized data-keeping system/ software. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such system, for either manipulation of the data, or the management of the database structure itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DBMS is like a car, meaning, there is no need to have an internal understanding of how a car works in order to drive it. Meaning, to know how to use a DBMS, there is no need to know how a DBMS works internally. The only thing that should be known is, how to write queries on the top of it, to extract data from it (which is what the role of Data Scientist/ Analyst requires).\n",
    "\n",
    "DBMS is also called as R-DBMS. The R in R-DBMS stands for relational. Relational means a table. DBMS typically stores data that is in the form of tables, it means it is structured, or there is structure to that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also another kind of DBMS software that is used to store data that isn't in the form of tables. Such kind falls under NoSQL databases. This kind is exactly opposite to structured, they help in dealing with unstructured data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of unstructured data include: images, texts, graphs (connected maps), documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of a company that creates NoSQL type of databases is MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",

    "This is because of the transition from the `.com` bubble to social media bubble, all the data has become unstructured. To solve this problem, NoSQL became very important.\n",

    "1. DBMS are good to store, and perform transactions on the data. But, they are not so great when analyzing the data.\n",

    "3. Can handle data in the quantity of terra bytes.\n",

Attributes are represented by oval/ ellipses connected to their respective entities. For example, attributes of a Student entity could include Student_ID, Name, and GPA.\n",
    "3. Relationship: A relationship is an association between entities. It describes how entities are related to each other. Relationships are represented by lines connecting entities, with optional annotations (diamond) to describe the nature of the relationship.

    "\n",
    "### Alternative Explanation\n",
    "In Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, relationships represent the connections between different entities (tables) that store data in your database. There are three main types of relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-to-One (1:1): In this relationship, a single record in one entity is associated with exactly one record in another entity. Here are some examples:\n",
    "    - A `Customer` entity can have only one `BillingAddress`\n",
    "    - A `Passport` entity can be linked to only one `Person`\n",
    "2. One-to-Many (1:N): This is the most common type of relationship. A single record in one entity (the \"one\" side) is associated with multiple records in another entity (the \"many\" side). Examples include:\n",
    "    - A `Course` entity can have many `Student`s enrolled (one course, many students)\n",
    "    - An `Order` entity can have many `OrderLine` entries (one order, many items)\n",
    "3. Many-to-Many (N:M): In this relationship, multiple records in one entity can be associated with multiple records in another entity. A separate table is typically needed to represent the many-to-many connection. Here are some examples:\n",
    "    - A `Student` can enroll in many `Course`s, and a `Course` can have many `Student`s enrolled (many students, many courses) - An additional table, `Enrollment`, would be required to capture this relationship, specifying which students are enrolled in which courses.\n",
    "    - A `Movie` can have many `Actor`s, and an `Actor` can be in many `Movie`s (many actors, many movies) - An additional table, `Cast`, would be needed to show which actors appear in which movies."

    "1. DDL (Data Definition Language): This type of SQL is used to create tables. Anything that has to do with the table schema where the tables are defined, is done using DDL.\n",
    "Commands like, CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, are a part of DDL.\n",

    "Commands like, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, are a part of DML.\n",
    "3. TCL (Transaction Control Language): This deals with how the data transactions are happening. For example, until the COMMIT command is run the data will not get saved. \n",
    "Commands like, SAVE POINT, ROLL BACK, COMMIT, are a part of TCL.\n",
    "4. DQL (Data Query Language): [This type of SQL is most used by a Data Analyst/ Scientist].\n",
    "This deals with how required data can be extracted from the database. SELECT, FROM, WHERE are the 3 major clauses that are used in DQL.\n",
