    "2. Object creation: To create an instance of the class, the class name followed by parenthesis is used. This is called object creation or instantiation. Instantiation allocates memory for the object and sets up its initial state based on the class's constructor (usually the `__init__` method in Python). Meaning, if the class is expected to be instantiated with certain attributes, then those attributes have to be passed while the object is being created.\n",
    "3. Accessing attributes and methods: Once the object is created, its attributes can be accessed and its methods can be called as defined in the class. Each object will have its own set of data but shares the same methods and behaviors defined by the class."

    "# Instance Variable\n",
    "An instance variable, also known as an instance attribute, is a variable that belongs to a specific instance (object) of a class in OOP. These variables store data that is unique to each instance and are distinct from class variables, which are shared among all instances of a class. Instance variables are used to store and manage object-specific data and are defined within the methods of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key aspects\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Each instance of a class has its own set of instance variables, which means that the data stored in these variables can vary from one object to another. These variables are associated with the specific instance to which they belong.\n",
    "2. Defined in methods: Instance variables are typically defined within the methods (especially the constructor or `__init__()` method) of a class. When an object is created, the constructor is responsible for initializing the instance variables with their initial values.\n",
    "3. Accessed via `self`: In most object-oriented programming languages, including Python, instance variables are accessed and manipulated using the `self` keyword, which refers to the current instance. For example, `self.variable_name` is used to access and modify an instance variable.\n",
    "4. Data storage: Instance variables are used to store and manage data specific to an object. For example, in a class representing `Person`, instance variables may include `name`, `age` and `address`, each holding data specific to an individual person.\n",
    "5. Object's state: Instance variables contribute to defining the state of an object. The combination of values stored in these variables characterizes the object's unique attributes.\n",
    "6. Scope: The scope of an instance variable is limited to the specific instance to which it belongs. It cannot be accessed directly from other instances or outside the class unless it is defined as a public attribute."
