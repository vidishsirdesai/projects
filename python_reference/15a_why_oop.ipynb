    "# Why OOP?\n",
    "There are 4 principles upon which OOP is built,\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves, grouping objects with similar use cases or properties and actions in one place to manage them in a better fashion.\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Hiding.\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Parent-child relationships.\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: The property exihibited by the same object portraying different behaviors in different situations is called polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def random(): \n",
    "\tpass \n",
    "\n",
    "class Random:\n",
    "\tpass \n",
    "\n",
    "random() # Function call \n",
    "Random() # Class instantiation \n",
    "# The () were used to perform 2 things, which proves polymorphism\n",
    "# The following is another example of polymorphism\n",
    "# 1 + 2, result = 3 \n",
    "# \"a\" + \"b\", result = \"ab\"\n",

    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in OOP that refers to the building of attributes or properties and methods (functions) that operates on the data, into a single unit known as a class. This concept aims to hide the internal details of how a class works and provides a controlled interface to interact with the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key aspects of encapsulation\n",
    "1. Data hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal data (attributes) of a class from the outside world. This is achieved by declaring attributes as private or protected, which restricts direct access from outside the class.\n",
    "2. Access control: Encapsulation provides controlled access to the class' data. Instead of allowing direct access to attributes, a class defines methods (getters and setters) to read and modify the data.\n",
    "3. Information hiding: Encapsulation abstracts the complexity of the internal workings of a class. Users of the class interact with a well-defined interface, which shields them from the implementation details. This helps in managing the complexity of software systems.\n",
    "4. Flexibility: By encapsulating data and methods, the internal implementation of a class can be changed without affecting the code that uses the class. This promotes code reusability and maintenance.\n",
    "5. Modularity: Encapsulating promotes modularity by breaking a software system into smaller, self-contained units (classes). Each class has its own set of attributes and methods, making it easier to design, develop and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is encapsulation achieved?\n",
    "In object-oriented languages like Python, encapsulation is often achieved using access modifiers like public, private and protected,\n",
    "- Public: Attributes or methods marked as public are accessible from outside the class. By default, most attributes and methods are public.\n",
    "- Private: Attributes or methods marked as private are not directly accessible from outside the class. They are typically prefixed with double underscores (e.g., `__<variable_name>`) to indicate that they should not be accessed directly.\n",
    "- Protected: Attributes or methods marked as protected are not as restricted as private members but are intended to be used within the class or its sub-class. They are typically prefixed with one underscore (e.g., `_<variable_name>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self._account_number = account_number  # Encapsulated attribute\n",
    "        self._balance = balance  # Encapsulated attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Getter method to access the account balance\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self._balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Setter method to modify the account balance\n",
    "    def set_balance(self, new_balance):\n",
    "        if new_balance >= 0:\n",
    "            self._balance = new_balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "account = BankAccount(\"12345\", 1000)\n",
    "print(account.get_balance())  # Accessing balance using a getter\n",
    "account.set_balance(1500)     # Modifying balance using a setter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the attributes `_account_number` and `_balance` are encapsulated by prefixing them with underscores. Access to the balance is controlled through getter and setter methods, promoting encapsulation and data hiding."

    "# Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts in OOP that involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have. Abstraction allows to create a simplified representation of an object by focusing on the most relevant attributes and methods while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key aspects of abstraction\n",
    "1. Modeling real-world entities: Abstraction involves modeling real-world entities or concepts as classes in the software.\n",
    "2. Identifying essential attributes and behaviors: During the abstraction process, the essential attributes and behavior that define a class are identified. These essential characteristics are often derived from the problem domain.\n",
    "3. Hiding implementation details: Abstraction hides the internal details of how a class works, allowing users of the class to interact with it using a simplified interface. This separation between the interface and implementation is essential for managing complexity and making the code more maintainable.\n",
    "4. Creating a blueprint: An abstract class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) that objects of the class will have, without specifying the specific values.\n",
    "5. Promoting reusability: Abstraction promotes code reusability by creating a template for creating similar objects. This makes it easier to build new classes by reusing common attributes and behaviors from existing abstract classes.\n",
    "6. Defining interfaces: Abstract classes can define interfaces, which are sets of method signatures without providing their implementation. This allows for a standardized way of interacting with classes that implement the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is abstraction achieved?\n",
    "In object-oriented languages like, Python, Java and C++, abstraction can be achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is often used as a base class for other classes to inherit from. Interfaces define a contract that concrete classes must adhere to by implementing specific methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract class representing a shape\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.color = color  # Common attribute for all shapes\n",

    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concrete class representing a circle\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, radius):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "rect = Rectangle(\"Blue\", 4, 6)\n",
    "print(f\"Area of the rectangle: {rect.area()}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Perimeter of the rectangle: {rect.perimeter()}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Shape` is an abstract class that defines the common attributes (e.g., `color`) and abstract methods (`area` and `perimenter`) for all shapes. Concrete class (`Rectangle` and `Circle`) inherit from the abstract class and provide implementations for the abstract methods, thereby adhering to the abstraction defined by the `Shape` class."

    "# Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows one class to inherit attributes and behaviors (properties and methods) of another class. It is a mechanism by which a new class (sub-class or derived class) can be created based on an existing class (super-class or base class), extending or specializing its functionality. Inheritance promotes code reuse and the creating of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key aspects about inheritance\n",
    "1. Base class (super-class): The class that is being inherited from is called the base class or the super-class. It defines the common attributes and methods that can be shared by one or more sub-classes.\n",
    "2. Derived class (sub-class): The class that inherits from another class is called the derived class or sub-class. It inherits the attribute and methods from the super-class and can also define its own attributes and methods.\n",
    "3. \"is-a\" relationship: Inheritance represents an \"is-a\" relationship between the super-class and the sub-class. For example, if there is a class `Vehicle` and a sub-class `Car`, then \"is-a\" relationship means, \"`Car is a Vehicle`\".\n",
    "4. Code reusability: Inheritance allows to reuse the code defined in the super-class. This promotes the reuse of common functionality across related classes.\n",
    "5. Overriding: sub-classes can provide their own implementations of methods that are inherited from the super-class. This method overriding allows customization of behavior in the sub-class.\n",
    "6. Access to super-class members: sub-classes can access the attributes and methods of the super-class. They can also add new attributes and methods or override existing ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Base class (super-class)\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `Animal` is the super-class that defines a common attribute (`name`) and an abstract method (`speak`). `Dog` and `Cat` are sub-classes that inherit from `Animal` and provide their own implementations of the `speak` method. The sub-classes specialize the behavior of the super-class and instances of these sub-classes can be created with their unique attributes and methods.\n",

    "# Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super-class. It enables to write code that can work with objects of various classes in a consistent and generic way without needing to know their specific types. Polymorphism is often describe as the ability of different classes to respond to the same method or operation in a way that is appropriate for their individual types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key aspects of polymorphism\n",
    "1. Method overriding: Polymorphism is closely related to method overriding. In OOP, when a sub-class inherits a method from a super-class, it can provide its own implementation of that method, effectively overriding the method in the super-class. This allows different classes to have their own versions of the same method.\n",
    "2. Late binding: Polymorphism is also associated with late binding (runtime binding) of method calls. When there is a reference to an object, the actual method to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object, not the type of the reference.\n",
    "3. Interface or abstract classes: In many OOP languages, polymorphism is facilitated through interfaces or abstract classes. These define a common set of methods that concrete classes must implement, ensuring that objects of different classes can be treated uniformly.\n",
    "4. Code flexibility: Polymorphism makes code more flexible and extensible. It allows to write generic code that can work with a variety of objects, which can be especially useful in scenarios where there are collections of different objects but there is a need to perform a common operation on each of them.\n",
    "5. Example: A classic example of polymorphism is the use of a common method like `draw()` in various geometric shapes (e.g., circles, squares, triangles). Each shape class may provide its own implementation of the `draw()` method and `draw()` can be called on the objects of different shapes without knowing their specific types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self): # abstract method\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def animal_says(animal):\n",
    "    return animal.speak()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",

    "\n",
    "print(animal_says(dog))  # Output: \"Woof!\"\n",
    "print(animal_says(cat))  # Output: \"Meow!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `Animal` is the super-class with an abstract method `speak`. Both `Dog` and `Cat` are sub-classes that override the `speak` method. The `animal_says()` function takes an `Animal` object as a parameter and calls its `speak` method, demonstrating polymorphism. It does not need to know the specific type of animal, but it can work with both `Dog` and `Cat` objects seamlessly."
