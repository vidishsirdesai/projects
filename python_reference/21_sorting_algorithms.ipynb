    "# Bubble Sort\n",
    "Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeateadly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. It is called \"bubble sort\" because the smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list during each pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Run 2 nested `for` loops, the outer loop controls the number of passes through the array (the number of passes made are equal to 1 less than the number of elements in the array), and the inner loop iterates through the unsorted portion of the array in each pass.\n",
    "2. Start at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "3. Compare the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them. If not, leave them in their positions.\n",
    "4. Move to the next pair of elements (the second and third elements) and compare them. Again, if the second element is smaller than the third, leave them; otherwise, swap them.\n",
    "5. Continue this process, moving one element to the right with each pass, until you reach the end of the list. After the first pass, the largest element will have \"bubbled up\" to the last position.\n",
    "6. Repeat the process from the beginning (starting at the first pair of elements) until no more swaps are needed during a pass. This indicates that the list is sorted.\n",

    "# Selection Sort\n",
    "Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input list into two parts: a sorted section and an unsorted section. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted section and moves it to the end of the sorted section. Selection sort continues this process until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "Overview,\n",
    "1. Start with the entire list considered as unsorted.\n",
    "2. Find the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted section of the list.\n",
    "3. Swap the minimum element with the leftmost element in the unsorted section.\n",
    "4. Expand the sorted section to include the newly moved element.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire list is sorted. The sorted section grows while the unsorted section shrinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elaborate explanation,\n",
    "1. The selection_sort function takes an input list arr.\n",
    "2. It iterates through the list using a loop with the index i. The variable i represents the boundary between the sorted and unsorted sections.\n",
    "3. Within the loop, a variable min_index is initialized to i. This variable is used to keep track of the index with the minimum element in the unsorted section.\n",
    "4. Another nested loop (with index j) is used to search for the minimum element in the remaining unsorted section. If an element smaller than the current minimum is found, min_index is updated to the index of the new minimum element.\n",
    "5. After the inner loop completes, the algorithm knows the index of the smallest element in the unsorted section. The smallest element is then swapped with the leftmost element in the unsorted section (i.e., the element at index i).\n",
    "6. The outer loop continues to the next position, and the process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "7. The sorted list is printed as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large lists, as it has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$. However, it is easy to understand and implement, making it suitable for small lists or as an educational example.\n",

    "# Insertion Sort\n",
    "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one element at a time. It is particularly useful for small lists or partially sorted lists and is an efficient choice when only a few elements are out of order. The algorithm works by iteratively moving elements from the unsorted section to their correct positions in the sorted section of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion sort has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case, but it performs well for small lists, or lists with relatively few inversions. It is also an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional memory for sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Start with the second element (index 1) in the list. This element is considered the \"key\" for the current iteration.\n",
    "2. Compare the key with the element immediately before it (the left neighbor). If the key is smaller, swap it with the left neighbor.\n",
    "3. Continue comparing and swapping the key with its left neighbor until it is in its correct sorted position.\n",
