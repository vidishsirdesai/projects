    "# Linear Search\n",
    "Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple and straight-forward searching algorithm used to find a specific element within a list or an array. It involves checking each element of the list one-by-one until the desired element is found or until the end of the list is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Start at the beginning of the list or array.\n",
    "2. Compare the target element (the element you are searching for) with the current element in the list.\n",
    "3. If the current element is equal to the target element, the search is successful, and the index of the element is returned as the result.\n",
    "4. If the current element is not equal to the target element, move to the next element in the list.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2-4 until either the target element is found, or the end of the list is reached.\n",
    "6. If the target element is not found by the time the end of the list is reached, the search is considered unsuccessful, and a \"not found\" result is returned.\n",

    "# Binary Search\n",
    "Binary search is a highly efficient searching algorithm used to find a specific element within a sorted list or array. It operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the desired element is found or until it is determined that the element does not exist in the list. Binary search is also known as \"logarithmic search\" because it has a time complexity of $O(log n)$, making it significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is highly efficient for large datasets because it eliminates half of the remaining elements in each comparison, leading to a time complexity of $O(log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the list. This is in contrast to linear search, which has a time complexity of $O(n)$ and requires checking every element in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is commonly used in various applications, including searching in databases, sorted lists, and computer algorithms. It is especially useful when there is a need to quickly locate an element within a sorted dataset, and its efficiency makes it a preferred choice for such scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The caveat to this algorithm is that it works only on sorted arrays (lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with a large amounts of data, it is best to sort the data and then run binary search on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. There are 3 variables `start_index`, `end_index` and `mid_index` declared to point to the element at the starting, ending and the middle index (`mid_index = (start_index + end_index)// 2`).\n",
    "2. Check to see if the element at mid_index is the element that was being searched.\n",
    "3. If it is, then, return the index of that element.\n",
    "4. If not, then check if the element at mid_index is greater than or lesser than the element that is being searched.\n",
    "5. If it is greater, then start_index is updated to `start_index = mid_index + 1`.\n",
    "6. Else, if it is lesser, then end_index is updated to `end_index = mid_index - 1`.\n",
    "7. The steps, 2 to 6 are repeated until a match is found.\n",
    "8. Once the match is found, the index is returned.\n",
    "9. If no match is found, then -1 is returned.\n",
