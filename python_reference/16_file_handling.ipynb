    "# Introduction\n",
    "File handling in Python refers to the ability of the Python programs to interact with files in the device's storage. This interaction involves various operations like,\n",
    "- Creating files: Generating new files for storing data.\n",
    "- Opening files: Accessing existing files for reading or writing.\n",
    "- Reading from files: Extracting data from files.\n",
    "- Writing to files: Storing data into files.\n",
    "- Closing files: Releasing the connection to the file system after operations are complete."

    "# Why Is Secondary Memory Chosen Over Primary To Store Data?\n",
    "Primary memory, also known as RAM, is incredibly fast but volatile. This means data stored in RAM is temporary and gets erased when the computer shuts down. Hence RAM is used for running programs - it provides quick access to frequently used instructions and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, secondary memory, like HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) and SSDs (Solid State Drives), offer a persistent storage. Data saved on secondary storage remains intact even after a power cycle. This makes it ideal for storing important files, documents, applications and operating system itself. Secondary storage typically has much larger capacities compared to RAM, this allows to store vast amounts of information."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "# File formats and access control\n",
    "Data on secondary storage is organized into files. Each file has a specific format that determines how the information is encoded.\n",
    "- Text files (e.g., `.txt`): Use the ASCII character encoding system, where each character is represented by a unique 8-bit code. This makes text files human-readable but less efficient for storing complex data.\n",
    "- Binary files (e.g., `.exe`, images): Store information directly in binary format (0s and 1s). This format is more compact and efficient for non-textual data like program instructions or image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure data integrity and prevent conflicts, operating systems employ file access control mechanisms. These mechanisms, often implemented using locks, restrict how multiple programs can access a file simultaneously. Typically, only one program can write to a file at a time, while others can access it in read-only mode. This prevents data corruption that cout occur if multiple programs attempt to modify the same file concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that there are 2 files in a computer, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`. Now consider that 2 Python program files, `prog1.py` and `prog2.py` are both trying to access the same file at the same time. In such cases, the programs can only access the same file in read mode. Write mode is not permitted for both the files at the same time."
