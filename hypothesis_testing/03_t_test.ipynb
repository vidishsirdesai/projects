    "# T-Test\n",
    "A T-Test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of 2 groups of if a single group's mean is different from a known value. The T-Test is particularly useful when working with small sample sizes and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of T-Tests and the appropriate one to use depends on the specific scenario,\n",
    "1. One Sample T-Test: Used to test if the mean of a single sample is significantly different from a known or hypothesized population mean.\n",
    "2. Independent Samples T-Test (Two Samples T-Test): Used to compare the means of 2 independent groups to assess if they are significantly different from each other.\n",
    "3. Paired Samples T-Test: Used when dealing with paired or matched samples, such as before and after measurements on the same group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all T-Tests, the obtained T-Statistic is compared to a critical value from the T-Distribution or used to calculate a P-Value to determine statistical significance. The decision to reject the null hypothesis is based on a predetermined significance level (usually 0.05). If the P-Value is less than the significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis."
