    "1. Clarify: Ask clarifying questions about the new feature or product, and the main objective behind its release (monetization, engagement, retention etc).\n",
    "    - Is the \"Save Post\" feature used to allow users to save links, pages, posts, locations, movies, etc to view later?\n",
    "    - Does this also remind users about what items they have saved for later?\n",
    "    - Are we focusing on both aspects of this feature, or only the first? (i.e, first save and later access).\n",
    "2. Who benefits from this feature? This feature affects the users and advertisers,\n",
    "    - Advertisers do not want to be forgotten, so if they post something that attracts the attention of the user, they want the user to be able to find it again later, if they do not have immediate time to spend on it.\n",
    "    - For example, if there is a nice shoe advertised on Facebook, and the user likes it, but can't check it out now, or if there is a discussion about a TV series that the user potentially finds interesting to watch later, the users can save it to check it out later.\n",
    "3. Business goals:\n",
    "    - User's goal: The benefit for the users is that they do not need to copy paste or take a screenshot of the post they want to view later. They can have all these items in a categorized fashion (e.g. movies, pages, etc) and view them later.\n",
    "    - Advertiser's goal: Increase revenue by increasing clicks and impressions.\n",
    "    - Business goal: Increase user engagement.\n",
    "4. Define metrics: Note that not all the elements are applicable to all the problem statements. There are generally 6 stages of product's life cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally whenever a product metric is being given, a following classical framework is adopted, this framework is called AAAERR, also called as pirate's funnel."
