    "# How To Measure The Product Performance Or Success? (Defining Metrics)\n",
    "1. Clarify: Ask clarifying questions about the new feature or product, and the main objective behind its release (monetization, engagement, retention etc).\n",
    "    - Is the \"Save Post\" feature used to allow users to save links, pages, posts, locations, movies, etc to view later?\n",
    "    - Does this also remind users about what items they have saved for later?\n",
    "    - Are we focusing on both aspects of this feature, or only the first? (i.e, first save and later access).\n",
    "2. Who benefits from this feature? This feature affects the users and advertisers,\n",
    "    - Advertisers do not want to be forgotten, so if they post something that attracts the attention of the user, they want the user to be able to find it again later, if they do not have immediate time to spend on it.\n",
    "    - For example, if there is a nice shoe advertised on Facebook, and the user likes it, but can't check it out now, or if there is a discussion about a TV series that the user potentially finds interesting to watch later, the users can save it to check it out later.\n",
    "3. Business goals:\n",
    "    - User's goal: The benefit for the users is that they do not need to copy paste or take a screenshot of the post they want to view later. They can have all these items in a categorized fashion (e.g. movies, pages, etc) and view them later.\n",
    "    - Advertiser's goal: Increase revenue by increasing clicks and impressions.\n",
    "    - Business goal: Increase user engagement.\n",
    "4. Define metrics: Note that not all the elements are applicable to all the problem statements. There are generally 6 stages of product's life cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally whenever a product metric is being given, a following classical framework is adopted, this framework is called AAAERR, also called as pirate's funnel."

    "# AAAERR Funnel\n",
    "1. Awareness (How many people are aware of the product? Number of website visits, time spent on a website, email open rate etc):\n",
    "    - Discoverability:\n",
    "        - Percentage of users that have atleast once saved an item.\n",
    "        - Number of returns to saved content per unit.\n",
    "            - Percentage of users returning to view saved content organically (on their own) - user knows where to find the saved items and knows how to work with it.\n",
    "            - Percentage of users returning inorganically (i.e., reminded by Facebook to view saved content).\n",
    "2. Acquisition (How many people have started to interact with the product? Number of leads, number of qualified leads, sign ups, downloads, install, chatbot interactions).\n",
    "    - Number of new clients who want to advertise with Facebook.\n",
    "    - Increased spending of existing clients with Facebook since the launch of the save feature.\n",
    "3. Activation (When did the people start to use the product more frequently? Number of connections made, number of times an action is performed, number of steps completed).\n",
    "    - Adoption: Percentage of total posts saved ($\\frac{\\text{Number of saved posts}}{\\text{Number of total posts viewed}}$) Indicates the adoption rate of the save feature. Number of people using the save feature actively.\n",
    "4. Engagement (What is the breadth, and frequency of user engagement? DAU (Daily Active Users), MAU (Monthly Active Users) time spent in a session, session frequency)\n",
    "    - Average number of likes, comments, shares per saved post on a daily, weekly and monthly basis - indicates the user engagement on a broader level. Compare this with a general post with no save feature and see if the engagement is more with the new feature.\n",
    "    - Percentage of saved items that the user opens from the saved page.\n",
    "    - Amount of time spent on a page, after opening it from the saved page.\n",
    "    - The average amount of time it took a user from saving an item to opening it again.\n",
    "5. Revenue (How many people are paying for this product?):\n",
    "    - Percentage revenue increase just based on clicks and impressions made through the funnel that includes saved items.\n",
