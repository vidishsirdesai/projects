    "# What Is Guess Estimation (Guesstimation)?\n",
    "Guess estimation, also known as guesstimation, is a process of making an approximate or educated guess when dealing with a certain quantity, measurement or value for which precise information is not available or is not practical to obtain. It involves using one's intuition, experience and knowledge to arrive at a reasonable estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guesstimation is often employed in various scenarios, like,\n",
    "- Interviews: Candidated may be asked to make guesstimates during job interviews to assess their problem solving skills and ability to think on their feet.\n",
    "- Business planning: When developing business plans, managers may need to estimate future market trends, demands or revenue figures.\n",
    "- Project management: Project managers might use guesstimation to quickly estimate project timelines, resource requirements or budgets.\n",
    "- Everyday situations: In daily life, people often make rough estimates when planning activities, managing time or making decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a good guesstimate, one may use reasonable assumptions, break down complex problems into smaller parts, and rely on personal experience, or general knowledge. While guess estimation is not as precise as detailed calculations or measurements, it can provide valuable insights and help in making informed decisions when exact data is not available or is not practical to obtain."

    "# Purpose Of Guess Estimations And Approaching Guesstimation Problems\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The sole purpose of guesstimation is to check,\n",
    "- How structured is a person's approach towards making a near correct guess?\n",
    "- How comfortable is a person with estimating numbers?\n",
    "- Can a person perform back-of-the-mind calculations and validate them?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "1. Clarify: First try to understand the problem statement and gather all the information required for the estimation.\n",
    "2. Analyze: Analyze what all information is currently available and how can that be used to solve the problem in hand.\n",
    "3. Calculate: Note down the assumptions and use them as thumb rules to make calculations. The numbers do not need to be exact. Just specify a range of an approximation.\n",
    "4. Validate: Finally, validate the results in terms of the business metric. Make sure everything makes sense."
