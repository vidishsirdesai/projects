    "# Introduction\n",
    "Stacking, or stacked generalization, is a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple base models to create a more accurate and robust predictive model. Unlike bagging and boosting, which focus on creating diverse models through sampling or weighting, stacking leverages a meta-model to learn from the predictions of these base models."

    "### Base model training\n",
    "- Multiple base models (e.g., KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) are trained independently on the entire training dataset.\n",
    "- Each model generates predictions for the training and testing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meta-model training\n",
    "- The predictions from the base models for the training dataset are used as features to train a meta-model (also known as a blender or a level-2 model).\n",
    "- The meta-model can be any machine learning algorithm, such as a linear regression, logistic regression, or a neural network.\n",
    "- The meta-model learns to combine the predictions of the base models in an optimal way to make final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final predictions\n",
    "- The trained meta-model is used to make predictions on the testing dataset.\n",
    "- The base models are applied to the testing dataset, and their predictions are fed into the meta-model to generate the final predictions."

    "# How is Stacking different from Bagging and Boosting?\n",
    "- Model training: In bagging and boosting, base models are trained on different subsets of the training data. In stacking, base models are trained on the entire training dataset.\n",
    "- Combination strategy: Bagging and boosting combine predictions through averaging or weighted voting. Stacking uses a meta-model to learn the optimal combination of base model predictions."

    "# Advantages of Stacking\n",
    "- Improved performance: Stacking can potentially improve model performance by combining the strengths of multiple base models.\n",
    "- Enhanced generalization: The meta-model can learn complex relationships between the base model predictions, leading to better generalization."

    "# Challenges and limitations\n",
    "- Computational cost: Training multiple base models and a meta-model can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "- Overfitting risk: The meta-model may overfit to the training data, especially if it is too complex.\n",
    "- Limited gains: In practice, the gains from stacking may not always be significant, and it may not be worth the additional complexity."
