Meaning, in an ideal scenario, if there are d features + 1 relevant feature, the R2 score should increase, and if there are d features + 1 irrelevant feature, then R2 score should decrease. But in reality, the R2 score will be the same in both the scenarios.\n",

    "The R2 score represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (target variable) explained by the independent variable (features) in the model.
