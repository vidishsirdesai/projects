    "$P(A|B) = P(A) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is correct, because the result of coin toss does not have anything to do with the weather. Thus, no matter if B happens or not, the probability of A should not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of 2 independent events.\n",

    "$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{P(A)P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if 2 events $A$ and $B$ are independent and $P(B) ≠ 0$, then $P(A | B) = P(A)$. To summarize, \"*independence means, the probability of events can be multiplied to obtain the probability of their intersection*\", or equivalently, \"*independence means that conditional probability of one event given another is the same as the original (prior) probability*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the independence of 2 events is quite clear, because the 2 events seem not to have any physical interaction with each other (such as the 2 events discussed above). At other times, it is not as clear, and there might be a need to check if they satisfy the independence condition."
