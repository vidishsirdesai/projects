Whenever DDL commands such as `insert`, `update` and `delete` are used, the changes made by these commands are permanent only after closing the current session. So before closing the session, one can easily roll back on the changes made by the DDL commands. Hence, if the changes need to saved permanently to the disk without closing the session, the `commit` command is used.\n",
